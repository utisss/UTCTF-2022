description: I've created a new binary format. Unlike ELF, it has no bloat. 
  It just consists of a virtual address to store the data at, then 248 bytes of data. 
  However, when I tried to contribute it back to the mainline kernel they all 
  called my submission \"idiotic\", and \"wildly unsafe\". They just cant recognize the next 
  generation of Linux binaries.
