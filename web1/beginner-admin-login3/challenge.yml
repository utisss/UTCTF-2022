name: "Login as Admin Pt 3"
category: Beginner
description: Ok sorry but just *one* more time. HQ really needs your help. These Web D-EVIL-opers keep changing their site and preventing us from logging in. It seems the one thing they _won't_ change is their username and password \*rolls eyes\*. Can you figure out how to log in?


  _FYI, you do *not* need to do the `Login as Admin` sequence in order, and later parts are not necessarily harder than earlier ones._
