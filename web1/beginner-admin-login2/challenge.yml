name: "Login as Admin Pt 2"
category: Beginner
description: The boys back at HQ need you again! The Web D-EVIL-opers have changed their login page a bit, but we suspect the admin username and password are STILL set to `admin`. We're having trouble submitting the credentials, though. Can you help us out?


  _FYI, you do *not* need to do the `Login as Admin` sequence in order, and later parts are not necessarily harder than earlier ones._
