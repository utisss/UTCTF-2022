name: "Login as Admin Pt 1"
category: Beginner
description: HQ needs you to help them gain admin access to the Web D-EVIL-opers' site. We think the developers were a bunch of lazy bozos and just set the username and password to 'admin' but that doesn't seem to work. Can you see if we're missing anything?


  _FYI, you do *not* need to do the `Login as Admin` sequence in order, and later parts are not necessarily harder than earlier ones._
